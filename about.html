	<h1>Why?</h1>
	<p>There is a complex concept called Insight that has not a specific meaning, and it is present on all the great companies.
	<br>
	<br>
	For communication, it means - The 'universal' <strong>EMOTIONAL</strong> motivator that gives rise to a certain <strong>BEHAVIOR</strong> - as Mauro, who was my teacher at Digital Invaders, defined in his post:
	<a href="https://medium.com/@maurott/proceso-creativo-680c02c2ca9b">Creative process</a>. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I strongly believe that ideas can transform the world when they touch people's hearts, therefore, develop ideas based on insights assures us to achieve it, of course, as long as they have good implementations.
	<br>
	<br>
	For example, one of my favorite videos to illustrate the power of insights is the campaign <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wnjwjZH2PA">inmortal fans</a>. Here the insight is simple: passionate fans would do anything to support their team even after death. Therefore, the agency used that to create an organ donator card for a football team with the promise that whoever receives the organs would use them to support the team. The campaign increasing the donations by 54% in only one year and for the first time, the waiting list for corneal transplants went from 1,047 to zero, amazing, isn't it?. </p>
