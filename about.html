	<h1> Reason of existence </h1> <!-- Almendra accords -->
	<p>	With climate change, population growth, epidemics, overdue asteroid strikes, our planet is increasingly precarious, and there is no backup plan to preserve the continuity of humankind. Because although billionaire entrepreneurs are trying to create rockets fit for human travel and government agencies spend billions furthering their explorations, we are still a long way off from making our way to colonize another planet. It is for this reason that Almendra exists.</p>
	
	<p>Serving as a worldwide open AI-research initiative for space exploration, Almendra seeks to join efforts with space agencies to close technological gaps and advance faster in making humans a truly spacefaring race.</p>

	<p>This doesn't mean that we turn the back on Earth problems, quite the opposite, fortunately, there are already a lot of people and companies directly tackling them. So much that a little fact about astronauts is that after their first space missions, all of them see Earth in a new way, hence many of them become advocates for preserving our planet and taking care of it as long as we can. So, depending on perspectives, space provides down-to-earth benefits in areas such as health, mining, security, among others, driving us to improve our technology.</p>
