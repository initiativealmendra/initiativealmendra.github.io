There is a complex concept called Insight that has not a specific meaning, and it is present on all the great companies.

For communication, it means - The 'universal' **EMOTIONAL** motivator that gives rise to a certain **BEHAVIOR** - as Mauro, who was my teacher at Digital Invaders, defined in his post: [Creative process](https://medium.com/@maurott/proceso-creativo-680c02c2ca9b). 


I strongly believe that ideas can transform the world when they touch people's hearts, therefore, develop ideas based on insights assures us to achieve it, of course, as long as they have good implementations.


For example, one of my favorite videos to illustrate the power of insights is the campaign [inmortal fans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wnjwjZH2PA). Here the insight is simple: passionate fans would do anything to support their team even after death. Therefore, the agency used that to create an organ donator card for a football team with the promise that whoever receives the organs would use them to support the team. The campaign increasing the donations by 54% in only one year and for the first time, the waiting list for corneal transplants went from 1,047 to zero, amazing, isn't it?.


Here are some other videos of great communication ideas based on insights.
- [Bringing India & Pakistan together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_4vOUDImE)
- [The dancing traffic light manikin by smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB_0vRnkeOk)
- [Skip test campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8XV8FiUlhY)

So, insights are the connection between ideas and people, and we can use them to create technology too. If we are able to identify one of these general motivators, we can drive research based on it that helps us to solve the related problems. In that way, we can improve people's lives by building technology and therefore companies.

For this project, the insight is: *people are curious about whether a hairstyle will look good on them or not, but they don't dare to do it for fair that it will look bad or because they don't know how to explain it to the hairdresser.*

Nowadays, there are several apps (Like [Photable](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphatech.photable&hl=en) and [Style my hair](https://www.lorealprofessionnel.co.uk/hair-looks/style-my-hair)) that tried to solve the problem, but they are useless because although they try to solve the first part of the insight, the implementation is bad. So in order to create a value proposition for the user we have to develop an automatic process where you do not have to 'adjust' the hair, and where you can select any hairstyle that you want without limiting yourself to those that the app shows you as preloaded, we can achieve this using artificial intelligence...

Note that we are solving so far only the first half of the insight.
