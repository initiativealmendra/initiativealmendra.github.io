	<p>First of all, I am glad you are reading this. Although Almendra is about developing artificial intelligence its collaboration is not limited to only experts in the subject, so whether you are a software developer, a graphic designer, a video maker,  a copywriter, an astronomer,  a community manager, or from any other profession,  if you consider that you can collaborate in some way, then you are more than welcome.</p>
	<p>For that, please send an email to <a href="mailto:initiativealmendra@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="font-weight: bold;"> initiativealmendra@gmail.com </a> with the subject COLLABORATION PROPOSAL expressing what would you like to do and, as optional, since this is a worldwide initiative, it would be cool to receive your favorite song name that expresses something about you or your culture.</p>
	<p>I look forward to speaking with you to work together and make of Almendra the most important open community where people around the globe boost space exploration by leaving the seat of a spectator for the paper of an actor.</p>
